Auction Management System
Overview

The Auction Management System is a Java console-based application designed to facilitate online auctions. This system utilizes advanced concepts such as thread synchronization and data structures to ensure efficient and reliable auction management. The application is backed by XAMPP and uses SQL for data storage, providing a robust and scalable solution for managing auctions.
Features

    User Authentication: Users can register and log in to participate in auctions.
    Auction Creation: Registered users can create auctions by specifying item details, starting bids, and auction duration.
    Real-time Bidding: The system allows multiple users to place bids in real time, leveraging thread synchronization to manage concurrent bidding effectively.
    Bid History: Users can view the bidding history for each auction, providing transparency and tracking of bids.
    Admin Panel: Administrators can manage auctions, users, and monitor ongoing activities.

Technologies Used

    Java: The core programming language for developing the application.
    Thread Synchronization: Ensures safe access to shared resources during bidding, preventing data inconsistencies.
    Data Structures: Efficiently manages user data, auction details, and bid history.
    XAMPP: A cross-platform web server solution stack package used to run the application and manage SQL databases.
    SQL: Used for data storage, allowing for efficient querying and management of auction data.
